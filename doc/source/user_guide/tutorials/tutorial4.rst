Comparison of electromagnetic models
====================================

**Goal**:

Run and compare SMRT for different electromagnetic theories. Some of the
theories can be used only with sphere microstructures (qca, qcacp,
rayleigh), others only with exponential microstructures (sft_rayleigh)
and others can be combined with any microstructure model (iba and
different variants of sce)

To this end we create two ensembles of snowpacks with varying size
parameter:

- One snowpack made of a sticky_hard_spheres microstructure with varyin
  radius. Here it is possible to compare iba, dmrt_qca_shortrange,
  dmrt_qcacp_shortrange, rayleigh and different variants of sce
- Another snowpack made of an exponential microstructure with varying
  correlation length. Here only iba, sft_rayleigh and variants of sce
  can be compared.

Run SMRT for the different snowpacks and compare the electromagnetic
theories. Plot the result as a function of radius (see sensitivity_study
tutorial).

**Learning**:

- Understand which electromagnetic models can be used with what kind of
  microstructure
- Learn how to compute scattering coefficient, without running the full
  model

.. code:: ipython3

    import numpy as np
    
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    %matplotlib notebook
    
    from smrt import make_model, make_snowpack, sensor_list

Electromagnetic models compatible with spheres
----------------------------------------------

First we create an ensemble of snowpacks initialized with the sticky
hard sphere (shs) microstructure of different radii

.. code:: ipython3

    # prepare the snowpack
    
    thickness = [10]
    density = 350
    temperature = 270
    stickiness = 0.15
    radius_list = np.arange(50, 400, 10) * 1e-6
    
    snowpack_list_shs = [make_snowpack(thickness=thickness, microstructure_model='sticky_hard_spheres',
                       radius=r, density=density, temperature=temperature, stickiness=stickiness) for r in radius_list]

Now we create electromagnetic models which are only compatible with
sphere microstructures

.. code:: ipython3

    # prepare several models
    
    m_dmrt_qca = make_model("dmrt_qca_shortrange", "dort")
    m_dmrt_qcacp = make_model("dmrt_qcacp_shortrange", "dort")
    
    # continue by adding more model, runing and ploting the results as in sensitivity_study

Electromagnetic models compatible with exponential microstructure
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Next we create an ensemble of snowpacks initialized with an exponential
(exp) microstructure of different correlation lengths

.. code:: ipython3

    # prepare the snowpack
    
    thickness = [1000.0]
    density = 350
    temperature = 270
    
    corr_length_list = np.arange(20, 200, 10) * 1e-6
    
    snowpack_list_exp = [make_snowpack(thickness=thickness, microstructure_model='exponential',
                       corr_length=c, density=density, temperature=temperature) for c in corr_length_list]

and create electromagnetic models which are compatible with exponential
microstructures. Some of them are more flexible and can be also used
with the other snowpack made of spheres (explore)

.. code:: ipython3

    m_iba = make_model("iba", "dort")
    m_sce = make_model("sce_rechtsman08", "dort")
    m_sft = make_model("sft_rayleigh", "dort")


.. code:: ipython3

    # continue with running these models and plotting the results as before

.. code:: ipython3

    # prepare the sensor
    sensor = sensor_list.passive(37e9, 55)

.. code:: ipython3

    # run the model
    m_sft.run(sensor, snowpack_list_exp)

Computing scattering coefficient
--------------------------------

Running the full model is interesting but sometimes we only want the
scattering coefficient (or absorption coefficient). There are two ways
to get it. First option is the access the “emmodel” attribute of the
model and run it on a layer (not on a snowpack)

.. code:: ipython3

    firstlayer = snowpack_list_exp[0].layers[0]  # this is the first layer of the first snowpack
    
    m_iba.emmodel(sensor, firstlayer).ks

Second option is without the overhead of make_model. It is simpler when
the full model is not needed

.. code:: ipython3

    # need a new import
    from smrt import make_emmodel

.. code:: ipython3

    # then, make the EM model
    em_iba = make_emmodel("iba")(sensor, firstlayer)
    # get ks
    em_iba.ks

Comparing the scattering coefficient from different formulations
----------------------------------------------------------------

Most of the theories can be compared for the SHS snowpack. We compute
the scattering coefficient and assess the radius dependence

.. code:: ipython3

    ks_iba = [m_iba.emmodel(sensor, sp.layers[0]).ks for sp in snowpack_list_shs]
    ks_sce = [m_sce.emmodel(sensor, sp.layers[0]).ks for sp in snowpack_list_shs]
    ks_qca = [m_dmrt_qca.emmodel(sensor, sp.layers[0]).ks for sp in snowpack_list_shs]


Now we can compare the radius dependence:

.. code:: ipython3

    plt.figure()
    plt.plot(radius_list*1e6, ks_iba, label="IBA")
    plt.plot(radius_list*1e6, ks_qca, label="QCA")
    plt.plot(radius_list*1e6, ks_sce, label="SCE RT08")
    
    plt.legend()
    plt.xlabel("Radius ($\\mu$m)")
    plt.ylabel("Scattering coefficient (m$^{-1}$)")

Continue exploring:
-------------------

- Make a similar comparison for the EXP snowpack as a function of
  correlation length
- Explore the different behavior of the scattering coefficient as a
  function of density
- Get rid of the albedo warning by using QCA-CP instead of QCA.
