[What is SMRT?]

Follow this user guide to learn how to install SMRT and to get started. A few tutorials then go through the most frequent use cases.

For more detailed documentation you can browse the API reference which gives the only continuously up-to-date reference for default behaviours as it is auto-generated from code source. For developers who want to implement new behaviour in SMRT for their own use or for improving SMRT, we recommend to read the :doc:`developer_guidelines` and to contact the authors of the model to discuss about the best/most generic approach to solve your problem.
