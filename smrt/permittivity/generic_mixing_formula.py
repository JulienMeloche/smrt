    Calculate the effective permittivity of snow by solution of quadratic Polder Van Santen equation for spherical

        See :py:func:`~smrt.permittivity.generic_mixing_formula.general_polder_van_santen` for an alternative 
        function (more generic, but slower).

    Args:
        frac_volume: Fractional volume of inclusions.
        e0: Permittivity of background (default is 1).
        eps: Permittivity of scattering material (default is 3.185 to compare with MEMLS)

        inclusion_shape: Assumption for shape(s) of brine inclusions. Can be a string for single shape, or a list/tuple/dict of strings
            for mixture of shapes. So far, we have the following shapes: "spheres" and "random_needles" (i.e. randomly-oriented elongated
