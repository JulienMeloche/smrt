    Calculate the dielectric constant of wet particules of ice using Maxwell Garnet equation using water as the background and 
    ice as the inclusions. As reported by Bohren and Huffman 1983 according to Ya Qi Jin (1993), eq 8-69, p282.

    Note:
        See also Chopra and Reddy (1986).

    Args:
        frequency: Frequency in Hz.
        temperature: Temperature in K.
        liquid_water: Fractional volume of water with respect to ice+water volume.

    Returns:
        Complex permittivity of pure ice.
